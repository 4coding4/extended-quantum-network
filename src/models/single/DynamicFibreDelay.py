class DynamicFibreDelay:
    """
    Transmission delay model based on constant speed of photons through fibre. The travel distance is given by length
    of channel.


    Notes
    -----
    The default c refers to the speed of light in a f1 fibre cable, which is 200000 km/s, ~30% slower than the speed of
    light in a vacuum.


    Model parameters
    ----------------
    c:
        (float, optional) â€“ Fixed speed of photons through the channel [km/s].
